# Text to speed discord bot

Honestly im not sure why i made this but it's a simple discord bot that when the command is used it pushes a notification to the pc its running on and says the content 
of the command outloud using [Software Automatic moth (SAM)](https://discordier.github.io/sam/)

# Usage
`>message "title content" message content`

to set up the bot youre going to have to do it on your own it's pretty simple anyway just remember to enable read content
