# Text to speed discord bot

Honestly im not sure why i made this but it's a simple discord bot that when the command is used it pushes a notification to the pc its running on and says the content 
of the command outloud using [Software Automatic moth (SAM)](https://discordier.github.io/sam/)

# Usage
`>message "title content" message content`<br>

# Setup
`pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
[Discords Developer page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)<br>
To set up the bot you're going to have to do it on your own it's pretty simple anyway just remember to enable read content

then put the bots token in config.py
